/// WDF Spin Lock.
///
/// Use framework spin locks to synchronize access to driver data from code that
/// runs at `IRQL` <= `DISPATCH_LEVEL`. When a driver thread acquires a spin
/// lock, the system sets the thread's IRQL to `DISPATCH_LEVEL`. When the thread
/// releases the lock, the system restores the thread's IRQL to its previous
/// level. A driver that is not using automatic framework synchronization might
/// use a spin lock to synchronize access to a device object's context space, if
/// the context space is writable and if more than one of the driver's event
/// callback functions access the space. Before a driver can use a framework
/// spin lock it must call [`SpinLock::try_new()`] to create a [`SpinLock`]. The
/// driver can then call [`SpinLock::acquire`] to acquire the lock and
/// [`SpinLock::release()`] to release it.
