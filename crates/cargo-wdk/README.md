# cargo-wdk

A development tool for Windows Rust drivers based on [windows-drivers-rs](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-drivers-rs).

## Installation

To install, run:

```pwsh
cargo install cargo-wdk
```

## Commands

`cargo-wdk` exposes two commands `new` and `build`.

`new` creates new driver projects from pre-defined templates and helps you get started faster. It invokes `cargo new` to create the project structure and then adds all the necessary files from a template.

`build` compiles the source code of a driver project and creates a [driver package](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-packages). It invokes `cargo build` to compile the code and then runs other required tools like `stampinf`, `inf2cat` and `signtool` in the correct order to produce the final driver package.

## Usage

### `new` Command

```pwsh
Usage: cargo wdk new [OPTIONS] <--kmdf|--umdf|--wdm> <PATH>

Arguments:
  <PATH>  Path at which the new driver crate should be created

Options:
      --kmdf  Create a KMDF driver crate
      --umdf  Create a UMDF driver crate
      --wdm   Create a WDM driver crate
  -h, --help  Print help

Verbosity:
  -v, --verbose...  Increase logging verbosity
  -q, --quiet...    Decrease logging verbosity
```

`new` takes the type of driver project you want to create (`kmdf`, `umdf` or `wdm`) and its destination path (`PATH`) as inputs along with flags specifying log verbosity.

The last component of `PATH` is used as the name of the crate.

#### Examples

- To create a new KMDF project called `my_driver` under the current folder run:

    ```pwsh  
    cargo wdk new my_driver --kmdf  
    ```

- To create a new UMDF project called `my_driver` under the folder `my_projects` run:  

    ```pwsh  
    cargo wdk new my_projects\my_driver --umdf  
    ```  

### `build` Command

```pwsh
Usage: cargo wdk build [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --profile <PROFILE>          Build artifacts with the specified profile
      --target-arch <TARGET_ARCH>  Build for the target architecture
      --verify-signature           Verify the signature
      --sample                     Build sample class driver project
  -h, --help                       Print help

Verbosity:
  -v, --verbose...  Increase logging verbosity
  -q, --quiet...    Decrease logging verbosity
```

`build` takes a number of inputs specifying build profile (`dev` or `release`), target architecture (`amd64` or `arm64`), a flag enabling signature verification and a flag indicating a sample driver along with verbosity flags.

When the command completes the packaged driver artifacts are emitted at the path `target\<profile>\<project-name>-package`.

#### Workspace support

`build` supports workspaces. If run at the root of a workspace, it will build and package all driver projects in it. If the workspace contains any non-driver projects they will also be built but not packaged.

#### Sample Drivers

Building a sample driver requires the `--sample` flag. If it is not specified, the build will fail.

If you have a workspace with a mix of sample and non-sample driver projects, the build will fail as that scenario is not supported yet. In the future `build` will be able to automatically detect sample projects. That will remove the need for the `--sample` flag and enable support for this scenario.

#### Signing

By default, `build` signs the driver binary and catalog using a certificate with `CN = WDRLocalTestCert` in the `WDRTestCertStore`. To check whether a certificate already exists, run `certmgr.msc` from the Windows Run dialog and look under `WDRTestCertStore > Certificates`. The signing certificate is also included as `WDRLocalTestCert.cer` in `target\<profile>\<project-name>-package`.

If no certificate is found, `build` automatically creates a self-signed certificate, uses it for signing, and adds it to `WDRTestCertStore` for reuse in subsequent builds.

#### Verification

If the `--verify-signature` flag is provided, the signatures are verified after signing. For verification to work, make sure you add a copy of the signing certificate in the `Trusted Root Certification Authorities` store. For security reasons `build` does not automatically do this even when it automatically generates the cert. You will have to always perform this step manually. 

#### Installing self signed certificate (non-prod case)

The driver package that gets generated at `target\<profile>\<project-name>-package` post build also includes the self signed certificate `WDRLocalTestCert.cer`. Since the driver and catalog files are signed with self signed certificate instead of production certificate (CA issued). We need to manually add a copy of this certificate in the `Trusted Root Certification Authorities` store on the target machine where you want to install the driver.

To install the certificate on Windows, double‑click the certificate file and choose "Install Certificate". In the wizard, select the store location (Local Machine is recommended), choose "Place all certificates in the following store", browse to "Trusted Root Certification Authorities", then complete the wizard.


#### Examples

- To build a driver project with default options, navigate to the root of the project and run:

    ```pwsh
    cargo wdk build 
    ```

- To build for target `arm64` and the `release` profile, navigate to the root of the project and run:

    ```pwsh
    cargo wdk build --target-arch arm64  --profile release
    ```

- To build projects in a workspace for target `amd64`, navigate to the root of the workspace and run:

    ```pwsh
    cargo wdk build --target-arch amd64
    ```
